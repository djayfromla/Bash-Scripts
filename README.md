# This is my first Repo, I will be using it to upload Bash scripts that I create over time

To add an alias to your bashrc for this File and not having to name the comment everytime, you can use this cmdlet

lias gitread='git add README.md  && git commit -m "This is my first Repo, I will be using it to upload Bash scripts that I create over time" && git push'


Some may be practical, others may be just for fun to see exactly what I can do with Bash Scripting
